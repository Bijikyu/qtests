Here’s how to turn these utilities and stubs into a single npm module, following best practices for structure, documentation, and exports. This approach keeps everything modular and clear for real-world use.

# qtests

Testing utilities and stubs for Node.js projects.

## Usage

**Stubbing a method:**
```js
const { stubMethod } = require('qtests');
const restore = stubMethod(obj, 'methodName', () => { /* stubbed implementation */ });
// ...test code
restore(); // restores original
Setting up stub paths for tests:

js
Copy
Edit
require('qtests/setup');
Stub modules for axios and winston:

js
Copy
Edit
const { stubs } = require('qtests');
stubs.axios.post(); // returns {}
stubs.winston.createLogger(); // returns no-op logger
File structure
utils/stubMethod.js: Method stubbing utility.

setup.js: Adds stubs/ to NODE_PATH for resolving module stubs.

stubs/axios.js: Axios test double.

stubs/winston.js: Winston test double.

## How It Works

- `require('qtests/setup')` sets up the `NODE_PATH` for stubs (run once before tests).
- Use `stubMethod()` in tests for temporarily replacing object methods.
- `stubs/axios.js` and `stubs/winston.js` are drop-in test doubles.
- Everything is available via the main module export.

You can now publish this as a single npm package for any project! Let me know if you want the full code blocks as ready-to-copy files.

Absolutely! Here’s a complete, LLM-friendly README for your qtests module, with detailed, step-by-step instructions and clear explanations for every use case:

qtests
qtests provides lightweight tools and stubs for seamless testing in Node.js projects. It includes utilities for method stubbing and drop-in replacements for common modules like axios and winston so you can run tests without making real HTTP requests or generating logs.

Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install qtests --save-dev
or

bash
Copy
Edit
yarn add qtests --dev
Contents
utils/stubMethod.js: Replace an object’s method with a stub, restoring it after the test.

setup.js: Configures Node to resolve stub modules (like axios or winston) during tests.

stubs/axios.js: No-op axios stub.

stubs/winston.js: No-op winston logger stub.

index.js: Entry point with unified exports.

How to Use
1. Stubbing Object Methods
Use the stubMethod utility to temporarily replace any method on any object during a test. After your test, restore the original method.

js
Copy
Edit
const { stubMethod } = require('qtests');

const myObj = {
  greet: name => `Hello, ${name}!`
};

// Stub the method
const restore = stubMethod(myObj, 'greet', name => 'Hi!');
// myObj.greet('Brian') === 'Hi!'

// Restore the original after test
restore();
// myObj.greet('Brian') === 'Hello, Brian!'
2. Stubbing Modules for All Tests
Before running your tests, use the setup script to tell Node.js to look in your stubs directory first when resolving modules. This way, any code that imports axios or winston will get your test doubles automatically.

In your test runner setup (e.g., Mocha’s --require or Jest’s setup):

js
Copy
Edit
require('qtests/setup');
Or, add it as a pre-hook in your test command:

bash
Copy
Edit
mocha --require qtests/setup
Now, any require('axios') or require('winston') in your code will use the stubs from qtests/stubs/.

3. Using Provided Stubs Directly
You can also import the provided stubs for manual mocking:

js
Copy
Edit
const { stubs } = require('qtests');

// Use axios stub
await stubs.axios.post('https://anything', {}); // Returns {}

// Use winston stub
const logger = stubs.winston.createLogger();
logger.info('This will not output anything!');
4. Example: Testing a Function That Logs and Makes HTTP Calls
Suppose you have a function that uses both axios and winston:

js
Copy
Edit
// myFunction.js
const axios = require('axios');
const winston = require('winston');
const logger = winston.createLogger();

module.exports = async function myFunction() {
  await axios.post('https://api.example.com/test', {});
  logger.info('Posted to API');
};
Test:

js
Copy
Edit
require('qtests/setup'); // Must be called before requiring your module

const myFunction = require('./myFunction'); // Will use stubbed axios and winston

(async () => {
  await myFunction(); // Does nothing real: no network, no logs!
})();
5. Directory Structure
A typical project setup might look like:

perl

├── test/
│   └── my-test.js
├── myFunction.js
├── package.json
└── ... (qtests installed here)
API Reference
stubMethod(obj, method, replacement)
obj: The object whose method you want to stub.

method: The string name of the method to replace.

replacement: The new function to use during the test.

Returns: A function. Call it to restore the original method after the test.

setup.js
When required, adds the included stubs/ directory to Node’s module resolution path, so stubs are used automatically.

stubs/axios.js and stubs/winston.js
axios.post: An async function that returns an empty object.

winston.createLogger(): Returns an object with no-op logging methods (info, warn, error, etc.).

FAQ
Q: Will this module interfere with my production code?
A: No! Only include it in your test setup. Your real code and dependencies are untouched in production.

Q: Can I extend or customize the stubs?
A: Yes! You can copy and modify the stubs as needed or contribute improvements.

This module helps you run fast, reliable, side-effect-free tests—no HTTP calls, no logs, no real file access—using simple, explicit stubbing for any object or module.

Happy testing!
