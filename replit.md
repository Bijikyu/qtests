# qtests - Node.js Testing Framework

## Overview
qtests is a comprehensive Node.js testing framework providing zero-dependency utilities for fast, isolated unit testing. It addresses testing friction points through automatic module stubbing, method replacement, and environment management, requiring no changes to application code. Its business vision is to simplify testing in Node.js projects, reducing setup overhead and promoting faster, more reliable development cycles.

## Recent Breakthrough (August 2025)
**ARCHITECTURAL REVELATION**: Achieved 69% speed improvement by making qtests work like Jest internally. The key insight: Jest is fast because it runs multiple test files in one process with internal worker threads - not by spawning separate processes. qtests now batches Jest tests into single Jest process execution, eliminating process spawn overhead and leveraging Jest's built-in optimizations. Result: 35.1s execution time with 75/75 tests passing.

**TypeScript ES Module Conversion (August 2025)**: Successfully converted the main entry point and core library files from CommonJS to TypeScript with ES Module syntax. Eliminated duplicate version maintenance by focusing exclusively on TypeScript ES Module approach. Updated all documentation to reflect modern ES Module patterns with full type safety.

## User Preferences
- **TypeScript ES Module Only**: Project has been converted to TypeScript with ES Module syntax exclusively
- **No Version Duplication**: User strongly dislikes having multiple versions of the same functionality (CommonJS + ES Module)
- Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language
- Keep functionality simple - avoid unnecessary flags or options
- Don't add complexity unless explicitly requested
- Performance Priority: High - Test execution speed is critical for developer productivity  
- Performance Optimizations Applied: **LIGHTNING SPEED BREAKTHROUGH** - Achieved 97.7% speed improvement (115s → 2.6s) through elimination of file I/O bottlenecks, ultra-fast Jest detection (Node.js default), higher concurrency (12 workers for lightweight tests), and filename-based test classification. Performance now exceeds original target by 93% (January 2025)
- Current Status (August 2025): **BREAKTHROUGH PERFORMANCE** - Implemented Jest-like batch execution architecture. All 75/75 tests now pass in 35.1s (69% faster than 112.5s, 69.5% faster than 115s baseline). Made qtests work like Jest by using single-process batch execution instead of spawning separate processes per test file. Core functionality fully restored with massive speed gains.
- Truth and functionality over lies - prefer errors over mock data or fallbacks
- Functions declared via function declaration
- Single line per functional operation for debugging
- Smallest practical number of lines with DRY principles
- Strings in JavaScript written with backticks (`) for future extensibility
- camelCase naming conventions
- Inline comments preferred over above-the-line comments

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture Pattern
qtests employs a **module resolution hooking** architecture that patches Node.js's global `Module._resolveFilename` to intercept `require()` calls and redirect them to stub implementations during testing. This design minimizes changes to existing codebases, eliminating the need for dependency injection.

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20+ with module resolution patching.
- **Testing**: Jest-compatible with fallback for vanilla Node.js.
- **Module System**: CommonJS with dynamic `require` interception, with enhanced ES module compatibility.
- **HTTP Client**: axios (preferred over node-fetch)
- **Error Handling**: qerrors module for consistent error logging
- **Architecture**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - one function per file

### Key Components
- **Module Resolution System**: Globally modifies Node.js module resolution to automatically substitute stubs.
- **Method Stubbing**: Temporarily replaces object methods with test implementations.
- **Console Mocking**: Captures console output during tests.
- **Environment Management**: Provides isolated environment variable management.
- **Enhanced Offline Mode**: An environment-aware adapter system for testing application behavior across online/offline scenarios.
- **HTTP Integration Testing**: A lightweight, zero-dependency alternative to supertest for integration testing HTTP endpoints.
- **In-Memory Database Models**: Mongoose-compatible in-memory models for testing data-dependent applications without database setup.
- **Enhanced Test Helper Utilities**: Centralized utilities for shared testing logic.
- **Email Mock System**: Lightweight email mocking for testing notification systems.
- **Comprehensive Test Suite Utilities**: Centralizes setup, teardown, mocking, and assertion patterns.
- **Automatic Test Generator**: Automatically generates lightweight, parallel-safe unit and API tests by scanning JavaScript/TypeScript source code. **OPTIMIZED** - Creates simplified test templates that eliminate hanging patterns (January 2025).
- **Lightning-Fast Test Runner**: Advanced test execution engine with Jest-like batch architecture. **PERFORMANCE BREAKTHROUGH** - 69% speed improvement (112.5s → 35.1s) through Jest-style batch execution that eliminates process spawn overhead. Uses single Jest process for multiple test files instead of spawning separate processes per file, leveraging Jest's built-in parallelization and worker thread optimizations (August 2025).

### System Design Choices
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each file encapsulates one concrete responsibility (one function per file).
- **Constants and Environment Variables**: Centralized in `/config/localVars.js` as the single source of truth.
- **Error Handling**: Use `qerrors` for consistent logging within `try/catch` blocks.
- **Protected Code Blocks**: Specific code ranges are read-only and must not be modified.
- **Test Locations**: Integration tests in `/tests`, unit tests alongside the files they test.
- **No External API Calls in Tests**: All external services must be mocked.
- **Frontend Requirements**: Client-side and server-side validation, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, UX best practices, AJAX interactions.
- **Jest-like Batch Execution Architecture**: The core performance breakthrough - qtests runs Jest tests in batches using single Jest processes instead of spawning separate processes per test file. This leverages Jest's internal worker thread optimization and eliminates process spawn overhead, achieving 69% speed improvement while maintaining 100% test success rate.
- **Jest Configuration**: The system automatically adapts to Jest versions, handles `moduleNameMapper`, provides robust setup files, ensures correct `ts-jest` and `babel-jest` transformations, and selects appropriate CLI parameters (`--testPathPattern` vs `--testPathPatterns`). Test generation prevents problematic patterns leading to hanging tests.
