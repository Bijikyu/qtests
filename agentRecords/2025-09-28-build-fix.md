Title: Fix TypeScript build errors before publish
Date: 2025-09-28

Summary
- Addressed TypeScript errors blocking `npm publish`.
- Restored encapsulation compliance and corrected generic inference.

Changes
- utils/testing/mockManager.ts
  - Add `registerMock(name, value)` to publicly register mocks without exposing the private `mocks` map.
- utils/testSuite.ts
  - Replace direct `mockManager.mocks.set('email', ...)` with `mockManager.registerMock(...)`.
- utils/testing/performanceTestHelper.ts
  - In `createBenchmarkSuite.compare()`, explicitly type `Object.entries(this.results)` as `Array<[string, TimingMeasurement]>` to satisfy TS 5 `unknown` inference for `Object.entries` values.

Rationale
- Respect private field boundaries; provide a minimal public API to register mocks.
- Ensure build-time type safety by guiding TS inference where it defaults to `unknown`.

Validation
- Ran `npm run build`: succeeded with 0 errors.
- Ran `npm test`: 87 files passed; no regressions.

Follow-ups
- None required. If additional ad-hoc mocks are needed, prefer `registerMock`.
