# Change Record: README updates for generator and runner

- Date: 2025-09-26
- Areas: `README.md`

## Summary
- Updated README to prefer `npx qtests-generate` (added alias), keeping `qtests-ts-generate` as a backward-compatible option.
- Refreshed CLI references, examples, and troubleshooting entries to use the new name.
- Added runner notes documenting `QTESTS_SUPPRESS_DEBUG`, `QTESTS_DEBUG_FILE`, and `runner-jest-args.json` behavior.

## Rationale
- Align documentation with the new, clearer generator command and recently added runner capabilities.

## Notes
- No behavioral changes; documentation only.
