## Express Router AST Improvements

- Area: `lib/testGenerator.ts`, `lib/testGenerator.routes.test.ts`, `qtests-runner.mjs`, `lib/summary.md`
- Goal: Improve Express route detection to cover `express.Router()` usage, custom router variables, and nested mounts; generate scaffolds for all valid routes.

### Changes
- Added comprehensive AST detection in `extractExpressRoutesAST`:
  - Tracks default/namespace `express` imports, named `Router` imports, and destructured `require('express')`.
  - Detects app creation via `express()` and `require('express')()`.
  - Detects router creation via `express.Router()`, `new express.Router()`, `Router()` (named import), and `new Router()`.
  - Parses chained calls like `router.route('/p').get().post().patch()`.
  - Builds mount graph for `app.use('/prefix', router)` and `router.use('/nested', child)` and prefixes routes accordingly.
  - Emits routes for unmounted routers at root (`/`) to ensure scaffold coverage.
- Generation flow: write regex-detected routes synchronously, then add AST-only routes. This preserves backward compatibility for callers that donâ€™t `await analyze()`.
- Tests: Added `lib/testGenerator.routes.test.ts` to cover named import, destructured require, `require('express')()` app, chained `route()` methods, and nested mounts.
- Runner: Fixed a stray brace in `qtests-runner.mjs` that placed methods outside the class (syntax error under Node 20). No behavior changes.
- Docs: Updated `lib/summary.md` with the new Express Router AST capabilities and compatibility notes.

### Rationale
- Many codebases use custom router variable names and different import styles; regex alone misses these.
- AST parsing provides robust detection without requiring users to refactor route files.
- Synchronous regex generation maintains compatibility with historical tests and usage patterns.

### Notes
- No changes to `setup.js`, `LICENSE`, or `package.json` version.
- `bin/qtests-ts-runner` untouched; only the generated `qtests-runner.mjs` was minimally corrected.
