# Change Record: Add `qtests-generate` CLI alias

- Date: 2025-09-26
- Areas: `package.json` bins, docs, tests

## Summary
- Added a new CLI name `qtests-generate` that maps to the existing generator script (`bin/qtests-ts-generate`). The old name remains for backward compatibility.
- Updated README usage examples to recommend `npx qtests-generate`.
- Added a minimal test to assert the package.json `bin` alias is present.

## Rationale
- Users prefer a non-TS-suffixed command and it better reflects that the main runner is not TypeScript-based.
- Helps avoid confusion with older versions and clarifies the canonical command moving forward.

## Notes
- No changes to the sacrosanct `bin/qtests-ts-runner`.
- The generator CLI still uses `tsx` with a shebang and imports `../lib/testGenerator.ts` directly.
