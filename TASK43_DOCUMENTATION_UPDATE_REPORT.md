## Accuracy Verification

### Code-Documentation Alignment
✅ All documented functions exist and work as described
✅ All parameter lists match actual function signatures  
✅ All examples tested and verified to work correctly
✅ All setup requirements accurately reflect actual behavior

### API Coverage
✅ stubMethod - Core method stubbing functionality
✅ mockConsole - Console spy creation and management
✅ setTestEnv - Environment variable configuration
✅ backupEnvVars/restoreEnvVars - Safe environment management
✅ setOfflineMode/getAxios/getQerrors - Offline mode functionality
✅ withMockConsole/withSavedEnv - Helper utilities
✅ createAxiosMock/createScheduleMock/createQerrorsMock - Mock factories

### Usage Pattern Validation
✅ Setup order requirements clearly documented and tested
✅ Cleanup procedures verified to prevent memory leaks
✅ Error handling patterns validated against actual implementation
✅ Performance recommendations based on actual testing results

## Breaking Changes Addressed

### No Breaking Changes Identified
The qtests framework maintains complete backward compatibility:
- All original functions maintain same signatures
- All original usage patterns continue to work
- Setup procedures remain the same
- Stub behavior unchanged

### Additive Changes Only
All documented changes are additive enhancements:
- New optional utilities that don't affect existing code
- Enhanced functionality that builds on existing patterns
- Additional safety measures that prevent errors without changing APIs

## Documentation Quality Standards

### Maintained Project Conventions

2. **Code Example Style** - Matches existing code style and patterns
3. **Section Organization** - Follows logical progression from basic to advanced
4. **Language Tone** - Professional, concise, developer-focused

### Improved Accessibility
1. **Progressive Disclosure** - Basic usage first, advanced features later
2. **Clear Section Headers** - Easy navigation to specific functionality
3. **Comprehensive Examples** - Working code for every major feature
4. **Troubleshooting Support** - Solutions for common setup issues
