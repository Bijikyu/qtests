Absolutely! Here’s a complete, LLM-friendly README for your **qtests** module, with detailed, step-by-step instructions and clear explanations for every use case:

---

# qtests

**qtests** provides lightweight tools and stubs for seamless testing in Node.js projects. It includes utilities for method stubbing and drop-in replacements for common modules like `axios` and `winston` so you can run tests without making real HTTP requests or generating logs.

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install qtests --save-dev
```

or

```bash
yarn add qtests --dev
```

---

## Contents

* **utils/stubMethod.js**: Replace an object’s method with a stub, restoring it after the test.
* **setup.js**: Configures Node to resolve stub modules (like `axios` or `winston`) during tests.
* **stubs/axios.js**: No-op axios stub.
* **stubs/winston.js**: No-op winston logger stub.
* **index.js**: Entry point with unified exports.

---

## How to Use

### 1. Stubbing Object Methods

Use the `stubMethod` utility to temporarily replace any method on any object during a test. After your test, restore the original method.

```js
const { stubMethod } = require('qtests');

const myObj = {
	greet: name => `Hello, ${name}!`
};

// Stub the method
const restore = stubMethod(myObj, 'greet', name => 'Hi!');
// myObj.greet('Brian') === 'Hi!'

// Restore the original after test
restore();
// myObj.greet('Brian') === 'Hello, Brian!'
```

---

### 2. Stubbing Modules for All Tests

Before running your tests, call the setup helper so Node.js loads the stubs directory first. Until this is done, modules like `axios` or `winston` will resolve to their real implementations.

**In your test runner setup (e.g., Mocha’s `--require` or Jest’s setup):**

```js
require('qtests').setup();
// or
require('qtests/setup');
```

Or, add it as a pre-hook in your test command:

```bash
mocha --require qtests/setup
```

Now, any `require('axios')` or `require('winston')` in your code will use the stubs from `qtests/stubs/`.

---

### 3. Using Provided Stubs Directly

You can also import the provided stubs for manual mocking:

```js
const { stubs } = require('qtests');

// Use axios stub
await stubs.axios.get(`https://anything`); // Returns {}
await stubs.axios.post('https://anything', {}); // Returns {}

// Use winston stub
const logger = stubs.winston.createLogger();
logger.info('This will not output anything!');
```

---

### 4. Example: Testing a Function That Logs and Makes HTTP Calls

Suppose you have a function that uses both `axios` and `winston`:

```js
// myFunction.js
const axios = require('axios');
const winston = require('winston');
const logger = winston.createLogger();

module.exports = async function myFunction() {
	await axios.post('https://api.example.com/test', {});
	logger.info('Posted to API');
};
```

**Test:**

```js
require('qtests').setup(); // Must be called before requiring your module

const myFunction = require('./myFunction'); // Will use stubbed axios and winston

(async () => {
	await myFunction(); // Does nothing real: no network, no logs!
})();
```

---

### 5. Directory Structure

A typical project setup might look like:

```
project-root/
├── node_modules/
├── test/
│   └── my-test.js
├── myFunction.js
├── package.json
└── ... (qtests installed here)
```

---

## API Reference

### `stubMethod(obj, method, replacement)`

* **obj**: The object whose method you want to stub.
* **method**: The string name of the method to replace.
* **replacement**: The new function to use during the test.

**Returns**: A function. Call it to restore the original method after the test.

---

### `setup.js`

When required, adds the included `stubs/` directory to Node’s module resolution path, so stubs are used automatically.

---

### `stubs/axios.js` and `stubs/winston.js`

* `axios.post`: An async function that returns an empty object.
* `axios.get`: An async function that returns an empty object.
* `winston.createLogger()`: Returns an object with no-op logging methods (`info`, `warn`, `error`, etc.).

## FAQ

**Q: Will this module interfere with my production code?**
A: No! Only include it in your test setup. Your real code and dependencies are untouched in production.

**Q: Can I extend or customize the stubs?**
A: Yes! You can copy and modify the stubs as needed or contribute improvements.
