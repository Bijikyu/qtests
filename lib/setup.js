/**
 * Setup and Initialization Utilities
 * 
 * This module provides setup functionality for the qtests framework.
 * The setup function modifies global Node.js behavior to enable automatic
 * stub resolution, which is essential for seamless testing.
 * 
 * Design philosophy:
 * - Explicit setup to avoid unintended side effects
 * - Clear separation of setup from other utilities
 * - Comprehensive error handling and logging
 * - Safe to call multiple times
 * 
 * Why explicit setup is necessary:
 * 1. Modifying Node.js module resolution is a global side effect
 * 2. Users should explicitly opt-in to this behavior modification
 * 3. Setup timing is critical - must happen before module requires
 * 4. Clear separation makes it obvious when global behavior is being changed
 * 
 * Alternative approaches considered:
 * - Automatic setup on require: Rejected due to hidden side effects
 * - Setup in individual utilities: Rejected due to timing complexity
 * - Multiple setup functions: Rejected for simplicity
 * 
 * Current approach benefits:
 * - Clear, explicit user intent required
 * - Single point of global behavior modification
 * - Easy to understand and debug
 * - Follows principle of least surprise

/**
 * Initialize qtests framework with automatic stub resolution
 * 
 * This function modifies Node.js module resolution to automatically
 * substitute stub implementations for real modules during testing.
 * 
 * Implementation rationale:
 * 1. Function wrapper provides explicit call syntax for users
 * 2. Lazy loading of setup module prevents accidental side effects
 * 3. Error handling ensures setup failures are clearly reported
 * 4. Logging provides visibility into setup process for debugging
 * 
 * Why a function wrapper instead of direct require:
 * - Makes setup intention explicit in user code
 * - Allows error handling and logging at the API level
 * - Provides a clear point for future enhancement (parameters, options)
 * - Follows common Node.js patterns for initialization functions
 * 
 * Critical timing requirement:
 * This function MUST be called before requiring any modules that need stubbing.
 * If axios or winston are required before setup(), they will be the real modules.
 * 
 * @returns {undefined} No return value - this is a side-effect function
 * @throws {Error} Propagates any errors from the setup module
