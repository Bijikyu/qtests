Based on my analysis, here's how qtests compares to Jest and Mocha functionality:

Features Jest/Mocha Have That qtests Currently Lacks:
Advanced Matchers & Assertions
Jest/Chai have extensive matchers qtests doesn't:

toBeCloseTo() for floating point comparisons
toMatch() / toContain() for string/regex matching
toBeGreaterThan() / toBeLessThan() for number comparisons
toHaveProperty() with nested property support
toHaveBeenCalledWith() / toHaveBeenCalledTimes() for mock verification
resolves / rejects for promise testing
Custom matcher extensibility
qtests has: Basic equal, truthy, falsy, throws, contains, hasProperty

Test Organization & Hooks
Jest/Mocha have:

describe() blocks for grouping tests
beforeAll() / afterAll() / beforeEach() / afterEach() hooks
Nested describe blocks with scoped setup/teardown
qtests has: Simple test arrays with no built-in setup/teardown hooks

Async Testing
Jest/Mocha have:

Native async/await support
Promise resolution/rejection testing
Callback testing with done()
Timeout configuration
qtests has: Basic async support but no specialized async matchers

Reporting & Output
Jest/Mocha have:

Multiple reporter formats (TAP, JSON, spec, dot, etc.)
Code coverage reporting
Watch mode with file change detection
Snapshot testing (Jest)
qtests has: Simple console output with colored results

Mocking & Spying
Jest has built-in:

jest.fn() mock functions with call tracking
jest.spyOn() for method spying
Module mocking with jest.mock()
Mock implementation control
qtests has: Basic stubbing but no sophisticated mock/spy system

Configuration & Extensibility
Jest/Mocha have:

Extensive configuration files
Plugin systems
Custom environments (jsdom, node)
Module transformation
qtests has: Minimal configuration

What qtests Does Well That's Unique:
Zero dependency testing - Works without external frameworks
Module resolution patching - Automatic stub injection
Integrated utilities - Built-in environment management, HTTP testing, email mocking
Self-testing capability - Can test itself with its own framework
Conclusion:
Jest and Mocha are more feature-complete testing frameworks with extensive matchers, hooks, reporting, and ecosystem support. qtests is more of a lightweight testing utility library focused on specific pain points like stubbing and environment management.

qtests could benefit from adding more matchers, describe/hook support, and better async testing capabilities to compete as a full testing framework replacement.
