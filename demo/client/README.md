QTests Demo Frontend

- Minimal React component lives under `src/App.jsx`.
- This demo does not include a bundler or dev server to keep the CI footprint small; the goal is to validate qtests runner and backend stubs.
- If you want to run a local UI, add Vite and a minimal `index.html`/`main.jsx` and wire `start:client`.
